# Cryptocurrencies
---
## Overview:
---

For our analysis we have been tasked by Martha, a senior manager for the Advisory Services Team at the prominent investment bank Accountability Accounting, to help offer a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. We will create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. We will use unsupervised machine learning, since there is no known output, to analyze a database of cryptocurrencies to create the report. To the complete our analysis we will: preprocess the database, reduce the data dimensions using Principal Component Analysis, cluster cryptocurrencies using K-means modeling, and finally visualize the classification results with 2D and 3D scatter plots.
